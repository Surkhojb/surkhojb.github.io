      <description>Today I am going to talk about order, because yes, the order is something very important in life and also in software development.
Sometimes when I forgot something or I don’t remember where I can find it, one of my dad’s quote comes to my mind: &amp;ldquo;Is better a short pencil than a big memory” ( This is literally translated from Spanish.), The meaning of it is that is better to take notes than try to remember everything, because sooner or later we will forget about it.</description>

      <description>Since I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with Github Actions, I started to enjoy using it to build anything, so I thought about using it with Android and Firebase. Because you know, Android and Firebase always are a great mix, but now we will add a new ingredient to create a great cocktail.
Our cocktail will help us to deploy an apk file for our tester team, instead of doing it manually we are going to add our magic ingredient: a Github Action workflow!</description>
